🎨Image Colorization Web App (Flask + Deep Learning)

This project is a Beautiful UI Image Colorizer built using Flask and a TorchScript deep learning model(colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt,colorization_release_v2.caffemodel).
It allows users to upload black-and-white images and get back fully colorized output instantly.

✨ Features

🖤 Upload grayscale / old / black-and-white photos

🌈 Colorization using a pretrained deep learning model

⚡ Fast inference (TorchScript)

💻 Beautiful modern UI

🧠 Model auto-loads on startup

📥 Download colorized output


💡 How It Works

User uploads a grayscale image

Flask saves it to static/uploads

The PyTorch model processes the image

Colorized image is saved to static/outputs

User sees a beautifully colorized version with a download option
